# Personal/portfolio Site
This is the code I use to deploy my website! It is an Angular 8 (really only 2+. I don't think I'm using anything too specific to 8 yet) app. Personal projects, blog posts, and my contact information are hosted here!

## Why Angular?
I've used web frameworks before, and I've never really used one I enjoyed a lot. With this project I wanted to accomplish two specific things: use a popular framework, and learn JavaScript. Under these constrants I lose a few frameworks and platforms that I've used or researched. Ruby on Rails is popular, but not JavaScript. Flask falls to the same restrictions as well. 

Choosing Angular boiled down to: I've heard enough about Angular and its component structure to be intrigued, and it's a JavaScript framework in a 'technically true' sense. It's actually a TypeScript framework, and I've written some Dart before and enjoyed it so languages that can compile to JavaScript are close enough.

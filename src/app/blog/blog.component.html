    <h2>Automanifesto</h2>
    <h5>November 2019</h5>
    <p>
        The most noble pursuit of the human race since time immemorial has been the optimization of laziness. All inventions have been in the pursuit of requiring less attention so that we can focus on the more important aspects of living, like how does our football team's head coach still have a job. The domestication of horses, the car, mass transportation, were all in pursuit of moving the maximum amount of human bodies with the minimum amount of human attention. Outsource your attention to a pilot! Or a train engineer! What utopian bliss. However, the place I am the happiest and like to spend the most time I must still physically assault a small plastic bar to turn on lights. To ensure I am not leaking unwanted light particles late at night I must wander methodically around the house. Why not have something on my phone that shows what devices are on or off? Why not be able to control those things from the small glass rectangle I constantly have jammed in my pocket? I spend most of my waking hours staring at it after all. I feel I need to be fair to the march of innovation, IOT technology has just recently reached the point at which the convenience of using my phone to turn things on and off has passed the frustration of it failing. The amount of swearing I do has taken a dramatic downturn in the last few years, and as a lazy, quick to complain, grouchy old man at heart I appreciate the improvement. I also feel the need to layout my plans and philosophy. If I don’t have a solid plan upfront, I will wander aimlessly around my goal and get nothing done. So before I get into concrete detail, I need to lay out the higher level concepts that will drive future projects.

        “Automation must make life easier.”

    <p>
        Firstly, automation must make life easier. There’s no point to most automation if it’s creating more work for myself. If automating a task takes more time and effort than performing it manually, it will not fulfill my desire to be the laziest version of myself that I can be. Checking to make sure lights are off at night, vacuuming floors, and repetitive mindless tasks can all be automated to take out the effort and human inconsistency or forgetfulness.

        Second, the automation must work. This could be assumed, but there should be a definition of what I mean when I say work. Automation can be effective and efficient, but when voice assistants like Siri or Alexa are introduced it can become frustrating. Something that works 90% of the time can be incredibly frustrating. Just when you get used to something working, it fails. It feels like such a betrayal, a stab in the back, for this small piece of inanimate plastic to refuse to do what you asked. So I’m looking for a high completion rate.

        As a third, final, or maybe a subpoint to both of the above: maintenance should be minimal. Constant maintenance that causes more work than the original task defeats the purpose of automation, unless it’s a pet project.

        The main inspiration, the first moment automation clicked for me, scratched that itch of efficiency and usefulness. The third time I came home to a Roomba vacuumed apartment, I had scheduled it to run automatically while I was away from the house at work. The first two times were cool sure, but they were initiated by me. I opened up the iRobot app, hit the start button, and followed it around my apartment watching it clean. I had scheduled it to run automatically while I was away from the house at work. I never had to think too hard about vacuuming my apartment again. Sure the poor little guy had a thing for trying to choke to death on socks, but the niceness of coming home to a vacuumed apartment far outweighed the few times I had to lift up the plastic puck, pull a sock out of its brushes, and set it back down to try again in a few days. Once I broke my bad habit of throwing socks around my apartment, I achieved maximum laziness to reliability. I wouldn’t see the robot vacuum for weeks, but my floors were never overly dirty again. The little robot made my life easier. I didn’t have to expend 30 minutes vacuuming my apartment anymore. The most effort I had to exert was maybe pulling the thing out from a corner it got stuck in, or to save it from choking on a sock. The little robot just worked, and that’s what I’m looking for.
